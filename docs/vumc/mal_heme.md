# Malignant Hematology Rotation Guide

This is one of the busiest, if not *the* busiest rotation we have.

On average, of course.

Staying organized is paramount.

## Typical schedule

Rounds usually start at 0800, usually starting on 10T with the lowest room number or sickest patient. 
Contact your attending and senior resident for details,
and if it's going to be a different time or place make sure to let the pharmacist know.

Bone marrow biopsies can be at any time during the working day, earliest at 0800 and latest at 1500. 
See below for more on BMBx logistics.

## Chemotherapy consents

- the new and delightful fact that the attending can sign remotely.
- Consent for the drugs only, not the route (e.g. IV or IT), not the amount, not the protocol.
    - If you are using a protocol that has optional agents, or alternating cycles with different drugs,
    consent for those as well, to not delay care when/if they are required.
    E.g. don't forget that Hyper-CVAD is actually Hyper-CVAD/MA, and often has rituximab as well.
- see the independent section on chemo consents at VUMC

    Make a page on chemo consents

## Chemotherapy orders

Pharmacists ftw.

## Bone marrow biopsy logistics

Bone marrow biopsy procedure guide should be a separate page.
The page here should have how to find things, scheduling, etc.

## Brittingham

Role and tips

- super senior resident
    - especially in July and August if the interns are res-interning 
      (but don't forget there is a "long" resident from one of the cancer services
      who is also covering and should be available to help)
- chemo champion
    - you are the arbiter (and bottleneck) of all chemo
    - You do the consent, write the order (or ask pharmacy very politely if you're swamped), and bug the attending until it's all been signed.
    - until it's running into the patient, don't assume everything is done (this is even more true at the VA, but here things go wrong as well)
- proceduralist
    - biopsies on new patients and D14 patients, etc.
- sponge
    - the attending, pharmacists, residents, nurses, and case managers have a lot to teach about the 360 care of heme patients
- consultant
    - read about the regimens, make recommendations, ask hard questions

## Consult service

Role and tips

## Triage

During the day, you triage admissions either to Brittingham or Browning.
It is ok, and encouraged, 
to transfer stable patients to Browning if an acute leukemia new start (or similar) is coming in.
Page or text the APP and attending on Browning if this is needed.
